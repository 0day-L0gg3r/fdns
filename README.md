Package **fdns** parses [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) [Forward DNS](https://github.com/rapid7/sonar/wiki/Forward-DNS) dataset in a concurrent way. The parser reports found entries (subdomains, IP addresses, records, etc) for the given record and domain.

Behaviour has changed since the project was created. Now `A` record reports DNS names instead of IP addresses.
